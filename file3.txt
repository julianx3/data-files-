Write a Python program to analyze weather data. 
Create a python file called weather.py
You’ll be accessing the past 24 hours of hyperlocal weather data from Pace’s weather station courtesy of Seidenberg’s Blue CoLab. Visit https://colabprod01.pace.edu/api/v2/sensors/ for more information on each type of sensor. Note that your answers will be different each time you run this as you’ll be pulling new data!
Copy the following code into the file. Run it to view the structure of the most recent data.
What’s the total rainfall in this dataset?
What’s the high temperature recorded in this dataset? (Records are saved in Celsius.)
What is the average barometric pressure recorded in this dataset?
What is the median wind direction? (Records are saved in degrees of a circle.) What do you think that maps to in cardinal directions (North, East, South, West)? 
What is the average (mean) relative humidity?
Print the most recent weather data. (It’ll be the last record.) Is it currently raining? What’s strange about the timestamp? Why do you think that’s the case?
Take a screenshot of your results in a terminal (or however you ran your code), copy the screenshot into your GitHub repository and submit it with the rest of your code.
